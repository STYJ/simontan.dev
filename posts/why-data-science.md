# Why I chose to learn data science?

My biggest motivation for wanting to learn data science is simply because I had this on my to-learn list for quite a while now. If I attemped it and concluded that I do not like it then at least now I know there is one less item on my to-learn list. That is how I am trying to beat my quarter life crisis!

The second reason for learning data science is because it synergises very well with what I am currently doing; working as a blockchain engineer. Public blockchains like Ethereum contain a lot of data and being able to find actionable insights from all that noise is hopefully profitable!

This leads nicely onto my third reason, money. It is hypocritical of me to say I am not in it for the money because I definitely am. A quick google search can tell you how much this industry has grown and will continue grow to but despite the growing demand for data scientists, there is an oversupply of talent for entry level roles.

As with any aspect of software development, the simplest way to standout is to do some side projects so this is my attempt at doing a side project to get my foot into the data science industry!

# How am I going to learn data science?

I am the type of person that learns better by building so I will probably start a side project that involves blockchain and some element of data science. There is also the very popular [Harvard's CS109 course](http://cs109.github.io/2015/index.html) (specifically CS109A for 2019) which I am planning to use if I unable to move forward as a result of a lack of sufficient theoretical knowledge.

As mentioned in my [other article](../what-is-learn-in-public), I will be documenting my entire journey and will feedback along the way if anything can be improved / changed. Looking forward to sharing and learning from you guys!
