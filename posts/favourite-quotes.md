Some motivational quotes that I am fortunate enough to chance upon (some of which are mine lol!) as I figure out the meaning of life. I believe these are worth sharing and maybe this might help someone out there. In no particular order:

> There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? If the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multi-planet species, I find that incredibly depressing. - Elon Musk

> Don't join a company simply to learn because learning can be done anywhere. You want to join a company to pick up skills that will help you to achieve your long term goal. - Aaron (IRL friend)

> Sometimes it's less about doing what you like and more of doing what you're good at. The benefits of doing something you're good at is that you can get paid for it and that it is easier for you to make an impact on someone's life. This is a positive loop that will keep growing. - Tenghui (IRL friend)

> If it's not fun, why bother? - Reggie Fils-AimÃ©

> If you don't want to sell your life to build someone else's dreams, do you have what it takes to build your own? - Simon (me!)

> Sometimes there isn't a right choice so the only regret you can have is not making that decision for yourself - https://youtu.be/x18bXxW3yhY

> Action skews the probabilities of success which others mistake as luck - MJ DeMarco

> If you need inspiring words, don't do it. - Elon Musk

> There isn't anything in the world that can't be made better. - Jack Valenti

> Don't equate the quality of a decision with the quality of its outcome i.e. You have control over the quality of your decisions. You don't have full control over the outcomes of your decisions. - Annie Duke

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit - Will Durant (summary of Aristotle)

> First do it, then do it right, then do it better - Andy Osmani

> When one door closes, another opens; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us. - Alexander Graham Bell

> People who call themselves realists are often just dreamers who got their hearts broken somewhere along the way - Ashley Stahl

> Life is never black and white. In fact, it's not even mostly grey. Life is an ever-changing colour similar to that of the iridescent hue of a rainbow. - Simon (me!)

> Per aspera ad astra (Through hardships to the stars) - Not sure... ğŸ¤”
