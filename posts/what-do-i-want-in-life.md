In the past few weeks, I thought about life more than I have ever done in my entire existence on Earth; not so much in a philosophical way but rather, trying to understand what I want to achieve in life.

Our fast paced and highly efficient society tempts us to live our lives like as if time is unlimited; like a cog in a well greased machine, consuming as a means of relieving stress and repeating the entire process again when the sun comes up.

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with consuming or being efficient. In fact, why work when you can't even enjoy the fruits of your labour? But when everything you do is dictated by societal norms, is that a life worth living? We sell our most precious resource, time, to live a life that we do not necessarily enjoy, going through the motion because that's what everyone did before we came along...

The last thing I want to feel when I am at death's doorstep is regret - regret for living life as determined by society instead of me. With that in mind, I realised that many of the things that I have done thus far were more in part due to what society deems a _normal_ human should be doing so I decided to stop going with the flow. Yes, life will carry on without me, markets will still run without me but I am no longer being swept away.

From today onwards, I am going to consciously choose how I want to life my life and what I want to achieve. I'm also probably going to slack off every now and then (I'm not a robot!) but since this is the life that I chose to live, I will accept it regardless the outcome.

To help me with this process, I came up with a few tenets:

1. Time - As cliché as it sounds, time is truly your most important asset. If you don't want to sell your time to build someone else's dreams, can you build your own? Spend your time on people and things you care about.

2. Fear of failure & rejection - it is okay to be afraid, you just need to find the courage to keep moving forward. Sometimes all you need is to take that first step.

3. Regret - The only regret you can have is not making the most meaningful decision that you can make at that point in time. Do not live a life of what ifs. Make a decision, commit and do your best. Regardless of what you choose, there'll be things you like, things you dislike. You just have to make the best of what you have because regretting means there was a right decision and you made the wrong one but you'll never know if your decision is actually wrong.

4. Integrity - Honesty triumphs everything. Life is hard enough so why make it harder by giving others a reason to doubt your true intentions?

5. Risks - Have the courage to take that first step and embrace failure, be responsible and acknowledge your mistakes. Your biggest risk is not taking enough risks.

6. Life - Life is NOT a zero sum game. Be kind, generous and have empathy because it is possible for everyone to win together. Do well by doing good.

7. Luck / Privilege - Luck and privilege exists; don't hate things you cannot control. Instead, make the most of your situation and keep moving forward.

8. Death - Death is always at your doorstep so never forget to live in the present.

To be really honest, I think many of us (myself included) will never find our true calling in life and that is **perfectly okay**. Our purpose in life will change as we age but at least we tried to live a life that we want to live. Do me and do yourself a favour, take a step back from all the hustle and bustle and really think about what you want in life. You have to be very honest with yourself for it to work.

P.S. there is also nothing wrong to wanting a lot of money!

Stay safe and thanks for reading! ❤️
