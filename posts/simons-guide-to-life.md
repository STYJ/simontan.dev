I have this recurring (and honestly, painful) problem where every now and then, I wonder about what life would be if I were doing something else. I feel like most of the time, this feeling stems from regret, what if I did X instead of Y. Why am I doing X instead of Y? What if there was a Z?

So in an effort to better understand myself, I decided to watch a few TED videos related to not knowing what I want to do in life. I summarised my key takeaways from these videos so that I can easily revisit them whenever I encounter this feeling again.

# Key takeaways

## [What should I do with my life?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo3e_0ITVjo)

- Ask not "what I want to be" but instead, "what I am going to be" and do it.
- Ignore your inner doubt, it blocks you from talking to your inner voice (the "person" that knows everything about you, what you like, what you fear, what you want to be.)
- If the world / your life is going to end in 2 weeks, what will you miss?

## [Stop searching for your passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MBaFL7sCb8)

- Passion is not a plan, it is a feeling and feelings change over time.
- There's this idea that if you pick the wrong job, you'll be stuck on the wrong train towards the wrong future. This is completely false. You're not going to be stuck, you are stuck now.
- You don't create your life first then live it, you create it by living it.
- It's okay if you don't know if this is what you want to do for the rest of your life. In fact, it doesn't matter.
- Spend your time and attention solving your favourite problems.
- Be useful and generous and people will pay you for it. That is where passion is, where your energy and effort meets someone else's needs.
- You don't follow your passion, your passion follows you.
- Just do it.
