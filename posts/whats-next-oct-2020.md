Halo internet, time for a quick update on life!

I am extremely happy to see the product that my colleagues and I helped build finally [go live](https://medium.com/xfers-sg/introducing-xsgd-the-singapore-dollar-backed-and-travel-rule%C2%B9-compliant-stablecoin-753ea48c7b8e) last week! As all good things must come to an end, so is my journey with Xfers. My last day at Xfers is on 31st Oct.

My reason for leaving is mostly because work was just that, work. It was not fun nor meaningful. The average person spends about 90,000 hours at work over a lifetime (which is A LOT mind you!) so if you're not having fun and enjoying what you are doing, why work? As such, I decided to take a sabbatical to explore my own personal interests, to focus on learning and really try to maximise growth.

My first priority after leaving will be tracing.money. Tracing.money is an automated data analysis bot that monitors the buy and sell volume on DEXes. By analysing the historical trading activity, the bot will report to me when there are irregularities. For example, the average token sold in the past 100 blocks is higher than the average token sold in the past 1000 blocks which might indicate a down trend. I am also planning to learn rust to make tracing.money because I think rust will be the next big thing in game development.

After which, I plan to do a deep dive into the Ethereum world computer, brushing up on my smart contract development skills, understanding best practices, learning about ETH 2.0, the EVM etc. I really want to try my hands at contributing to an open source project as well. I want to also continue with game development on the side. There's this new game engine called [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) that I am really excited to try!

I will also be documenting my learning process here and will share on twitter when new articles go live so if you haven't already followed [me on twitter](https://twitter.com/itsmeSTYJ), go do it now! That's about it for this update. Stay safe and stay hungry!
