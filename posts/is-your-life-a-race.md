Dear Simon,

Have you ever wondered if racing is all there is to life? A race to see who can graduate first? A race to see who can find a job first? A race to see who can get married first? A race to see who moves into a landed apartment first? A race to see who has kids first? There are many more examples of races we unknowingly participate simply by going with the flow, by doing what society deems we should be doing. Sure, there are some folks who prefer to live their life that way and that is okay but you know yourself better than anyone else - you're not one of them.

It goes without saying that for the majority of us (you included), if we see someone younger and more successful than we are, we tend to feel bouts of jealousy but that's just how life is. Life is unfair, you cannot restart your character like you do in a game simply because you don't like your starting conditions (FYI, it's already really fucking good) so when life gives you lemons, make lemonades. Make the best of your current situation instead of comparing yourself with others. Focus your attention on what you can control, commit and give it your all. Don't worry too much about things you cannot control e.g. the past, the future, others.

Remember that life is a game, not a race so don't rush the process. Live life the way you want to and enjoy the present because time, like water flowing in a river, can never be touched again once it's gone.

Stay hungry, stay foolish, stay safe.

Simon
