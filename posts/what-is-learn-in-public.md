I chanced upon the idea of learning in public through a tweet from [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx). In this tweet, he shared a recent post that he wrote about the benefits of learning in public.

My biggest lesson from that post is that learning in public helps you to accelerate the feedback loop when making mistakes. Your community will, theoretically, inform you if what you shared is incorrect. Moreover, by sharing what you've learnt in public, it can also benefit others since they don't have to go through what you did.

One of my goals for the upcoming years (~2023) is to optimise for growth; what that means is that in the next few years, I want to learn as much as possible with almost everything else considered secondary. In the [commencement address](https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/) for Stanford's class of 2005, Steve Jobs said:

> "Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important."

This is something I am trying to embrace as well, to only be concerned with what is truly important. As such, I am going to attempt to learn in public and make a lot of mistakes along the way but I believe it will work out fine in the end. :')

I am going to start my learn in public journey next month in the area of data science and will be documenting my entire process here so stay tuned for that! In the meantime, if you have some time, I highly recommend reading the [learn in public post](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) by swyx. Thanks again for writing such a useful and informative piece!
