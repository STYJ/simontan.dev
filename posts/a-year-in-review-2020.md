Halo internet, this is the first time I am doing this (writing it out). I decided to do a year in review so that when I look back next year, I want to be able to tell how much I have grown as an individual. The second reason of writing it out is because I want to acknowledge and celebrate the small victories, to reflect on my disappointments and to recognise areas where I want to grow. This is my way of remembering the past, living in the present and planning for the future.

Instead of writing a long wall of text, I'm just going to list them down in bullet points (in no particular order and not exhaustive of course). I also have a separate section for lessons I learnt from DevIt.tools.

## Victories üèÜ
- I got married!
- I joined some very talented folks at Xfers to help them launch the XSGD stablecoin!
- I definitely understand myself better than I do last year. I did _a lot_ of reflecting this year!
- I learnt about the math behind constant product market makers like Uniswap & Balancer.
- I made my first game with Godot!
- I picked up rust and enjoyed it!
- I started my first company!
- Did I mention understanding myself? lol.
- I made my own personal website instead of relying on a theme!
- I think I'm in a better shape than compared to last year.
- I put in more effort to meet up with folks who I think I can be friends with for a long time.
- I taught a few people about the basics of blockchain!
- I learnt to create a custom email domain using improvemx!
- I found myself a long term goal that really resonated with me!

## Disappointments üòû
- I don't think I can handle the cold as well as I used to...
- I am reaaaaaaally bad at trading lol.
- I dropped way too many projects this year. It feels like I'm forcing myself to do something but I end up not being motivated enough to continue.
- I didn't read as many books as I wanted to.
- I didn't manage to learn Japanese even though that was one of my goals this year. Technically there's still like 7 days left this year so I could definitely learn something before the end of the year.
- I had to rescind my offer to help others because I agreed too quickly.
- I'm still not a very good developer but honestly, I feel like programming is just a means to an end. I'm not entirely into [software craftsmanship](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) but I can definitely appreciate it.
- I probably spent too much time on entertainment e.g. youtube, netflix, anime.
- I am a little sad that my efforts for DevIt.tools kind of went down the drain because we started off wrongly (not motivated enough to solve automation, we didn't know anyone who had this problem).

## Improvements (TO DOs!) ‚úÖ
- To be a better husband, son and brother.
- To accept that whatever I think I know about trading is probably wrong. 
- To share what I have built with everyone. Be proud of your work!
- To think more before agreeing because once you agree, it's not professional to back out regardless of whether they're your friends or not.
- To read more variety of books instead of just self help / entrepreneurial books.
- To find something that I'm really excited about and to commit and work towards that.
- To help more people.
- To pick up Japanese.
- To remember why I did what I did so that whenever I am in doubt, I can always refer back to this list.
- To embrace the 80:20 rule.
- To learn and use first principles thinking.

## Learnings from DevIt üìö
- Don't start something for the sake of starting something.
- Don't jump onto the very first problem you encounter. You'll be spending a lot of time on it if it becomes successful so you must really want to solve this problem.
- You need to have a relationship with the problem because when push comes to shove, monetary incentives can only get you so far.
- Don't start with what you think you know, instead start with what you know is true.
- You need to know a handful of people who painfully affected by this problem.
- Don't fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy
- Try to resist the urge to spend money before you get any customers.
- You need to talk to your users.
