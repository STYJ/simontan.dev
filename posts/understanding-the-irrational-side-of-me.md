I started reading a book called **The Laws of Human Nature** by Robert Greene to learn more about human psychology, with hopes that one day, I will be able to reach a point where I truly understand myself. One of the many lessons that Robert emphasizes is that _you think you are rational, but you are not_.

To better understand the irrational side of me, I am going to start a journal to actively track my behaviour / reaction to certain incidents, why I acted in a particular way, what emotions were running through my head and the root cause for said emotions and how I _should_ respond if I were to encounter a similar incident again.

Here's a snippet from the book to get us started!

> The Emotional Self thrives on ignorance. The moment you are aware of how it operates and dominates you is the moment it loses its hold on you and can be tamed. Therefore, your first step toward the rational is always inward. You want to catch that Emotional Self in action. For this purpose, you must reflect on how you operate under stress. What particular weaknesses come out in such moments — the desire to please, to bully or control, deep levels of mistrust? Look at your decisions, especially those that have been ineffective — can you see a pattern, an underlying insecurity that impels them?

| What happened and how did I respond?                   | Why did I respond that way?                                             | What can I learn from this?                                                                                                                                                     |

| I held onto my UNI tokens despite price falling by 40% | Since it already fell so much, it doesn't hurt as much if it fell more. | CND taught you that falling by 99% is not impossible. Please don't make the same mistake a third time. For every trade you do, write out your SL and TP levels and stick to it. |
