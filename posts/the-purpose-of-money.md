I've been thinking a lot about money, specifically about the purpose of money. Historically, money was created to solve the [coincidence of wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants) problem - it was a means to an end but many of us forget about this and set money as our goal. In all honesty, I think there's nothing wrong with that. Money can buy you many things like happiness, experiences, freedom but money cannot buy you purpose nor a meaningful life. When you are at death's door, what was so valuable and wanted by so many people in the world suddenly becomes worthless. 

Hindsight is always correct but you don't actually know what it is until it actually happens. However in this particular scenario, everyone already knows how it is going to pan out yet we are still so obsessed with accumulating something so worthless. I'm not going to be a hypocrite and say I don't like money because I do but I think there'll come a point in life where money starts netting you diminishing returns. For those who eventually reach this stage, what will you do next? For me, I have decided that I will return everything else to society.

Imagine how much better the world would be if the top 1% shared half their net worth with the bottom 50%. Imagine how much more innovation can be had if people did not have to worry about meeting their basic requirements for living. The unfortunate state of the world is that the pie is simply not big enough for all of us yet everyone is selfishly eating their share of the pie. Blockchain is a first step, it gives the less fortunate a chance at the starting line but this doesn't fix the underlying problem - greed.

The thing is, greed is what makes us human. Humans are imperfect and that is the way we should be. I don't expect humans to change but I believe that by showing to others the benefits of growing this pie, it will lead to more people wanting to help to grow this pie as well. We only have one life so what do you want to do with it?
