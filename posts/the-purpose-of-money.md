I've been thinking a lot about money, specifically about the purpose of money. Historically, money was created to solve the [coincidence of wants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants). It was simply a means to an end yet in this day and age, many of us have money as the ultimate goal in life. In all honesty, I think there's nothing wrong with that. Money can buy you many things like happiness, experiences, freedom but money cannot buy you purpose nor a meaningful life. When you are at death's door, what was once so valuable and wanted by so many people in the world suddenly becomes so worthless.

That said however, I'm not going to be a hypocrite and say I don't like money because I do, a lot actually but eventually there will come a point in life where money nets you diminishing returns. For those who eventually reach this stage, what will you do next? For me, I have decided (even though I'm nowhere close to this lol) that I will return everything else to society.

Imagine how much better the world would be if the top 1% shared half their net worth with the bottom 50%? Imagine how much more innovation can be had if people did not have to worry about basic living expenses? The unfortunate state of this world is that the pie is simply not big enough for everyone yet we are all selfishly eating our share of the pie. This is the reason why I believe in blockchain technology. It also gives the less fortunate a chance at the starting line however it doesn't solve the underlying problem - greed.

The thing about greed is that it is what makes us human. Humans are imperfect and that is the way we should be. I don't expect humans to change but I believe that by showing to others the benefits of growing this pie, it will create a positive reinforcement loop that encourages more members of our society to help grow the pie as well. At the end of the day, we only have one life so what do you want to do with it?
