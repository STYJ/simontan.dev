"What do you want?" is an interesting question. Depending on the context, this question can go from being really easy to answer to really complicated.

For example, "what do you want to eat?" is a question that comes up a lot in my life. This might be a difficult question for some people but a no brainer for me - I want to eat something that is cheap and good. At the end of the day, even if I were to choose the wrong thing, it's not something I will remember and since it is cheap, my wallet is still intact.

"What do you want to do in life?" on the other hand is an extremely hard question with irreversible consequences. When I say "irreversible", I do not mean that you cannot change your train if it is headed to the wrong direction. You most definitely can and I know of many people who managed to successfully do a mid career switch to a completely different industry.

Instead, it is referring to the opportunity cost of having taken the wrong route; your time spent can never be regained but whether or not this is important to you really depends on you. Some might squander their time like as if they can live forever but for me, time is my most valuable asset. We should not try to avoid making mistakes entirely because that would be paralysing, as long as you learn something meaningful, it is time well spent. We should instead focus on minimising the number of mistakes made.

Going back to the question, what do I want in life? I ask myself this question a lot and unfortunately, I still don't have an answer for myself but I know a few things to be true for me:

- I want to build a business that is profitable now, not in 10 years. (money, sustenance)
- I want to focus on helping a small group of people solve their painful problems exceptionally well. (impact, focus)
- I want to work with folks that I enjoy working with and I truly care about. (happiness)
- I want to create a system of processes that can scale without additional effort from me. (time, freedom)

I believe that these [interests](../a-journey-of-self-discovery/#interests-that-i-want-to-explore) would fit most of these factors, I just need to go and do them. Ask if you do not understand and share what you've learnt online. Good luck and have fun.
