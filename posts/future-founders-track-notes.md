Here are some notes that I've taken down from the [future founder's track by YC](https://blog.ycombinator.com/startup-school-for-future-founders/). Hope they'll be useful to you as they are to me.

## Why to not not start a startup

TLDR: What are some common reasons for not wanting to start a startup and why some of these reasons don't necessarily make the most sense.

### Too young

Age doesn't necessarily correlate to maturity. A simple test would be to see how one reacts to a challenge. Do they immediately dismiss it as a stupid idea or do they probe deeper to understand why.

### Too inexperienced

The best way to get experience running a startup is to start a startup. Getting a normal job for a few years might turn you into someone that cannot move forward without being told.

### Not determined enough

If you sufficiently driven to work on your own projects, you are probably determined enough.

### Not smart enough

If you're smart enough to worry about not being smart enough to start a startup, you're probably are.

### Knows nothing about business

The initial focus is on the product. It must be something that people want, not something you think people want. Don't worry about making money, that's the easy part.

### No cofounder

A good cofounder is very important. Single founder startups are very tough. The older you grow, the harder it is to find a cofounder within your circle so start early! Young people have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

### No idea

Many startups pivot from their original idea to find product market fit. It also helps if you're good at making things. Find something that's missing in your own life and supply that need no matter how specific to you it seems.

### No room for more startups

Why would there be a limit for something valuable? If what you want to do will solve the need for a group of people better than any solution out there, you have a startup idea.

### Family to support

You shouldn't start a startup if you have a family unless you have the financial runway. If you really want to do it, start a consulting business on the side and turn that into a product business. Best to start when you're young and have no commitments.

### Independently wealthy

Startups are stressful so why do it if you don't need the money? There are many more interesting people doing regular jobs to pay the bills so if you want them as colleagues, you'll have to work at something that pays the bill even if you don't need to.

### Not ready for commitment

A successful startup is going to take at least 3-4 years. If you're not ready for commitment at that scale, don't do it.

### Need for structure

If you need people to tell you what to do, don't start a startup. A startup requires people to know what to do without someone else telling them what to do. Think of it as a soccer team. If you get angry when someone says you're not independent enough, you probably don't need someone to tell you what to do.\

### Fear of uncertainty

If you start a startup, it will probably fail. There is no uncertainty. Hope for the best but expect the worst. It'll still be one hell of a ride, you'll learn a lot and in the best case, you become rich.

### Don't realise what you're avoiding

Some people start startups because they know the regular job sucks.

### Parents want you to be a doctor

Parents are generally more conservative for you. They want you to be a doctor not because you save lifes but because it is a prestigeous job that pays well. There's still a correlation between risk and reward.

### A job is the default

Defaults are powerful but without people straying from the norm, we will never make progress. Startups are a rare historic shift in the way wealth is created.

## Before the startup

TLDR: A list of things to remember if you want to prepare yourself to start a startup.

### Counterintuitive

If you trust your instincts, you'll probably make a lot of mistakes. It is natural to immediately dismiss counterintuitive ideas but it is not always a good idea.

When it comes to people, it is okay to rely on your instincts. A lot of founders don't do that enough. Work with people you genuinely like and you've known long enough to be sure

### Expertise

The way to succeed in a startup is to be an expert on your users and the problem that you are solving for them. A lot of young founders go through the motions of startup a startup instead of actually making what people want.

### Gaming the system

We've been trained to find shortcuts to win this game called school since that's what we did growing up. Things that don't actually matter. There's no shortcut, the only way is to make something people want. It really is that simple.

### All-consuming

A startup will take time, a few years perhaps. A successful startup will take even more time, maybe even up to a decade. Starting a startup is really hard and it never gets easier.

Young successful founders will never get to do the things regular people do but likewise, regular people will never get to do what they do.

### Try
How can you tell if you're up for this challenge? You don't know. Most of our lives thus far has been pretty smooth sailing. It's nothing like running a startup.

Don't assume that your startup is going to be successful because you've managed to ace every (few, artificial, easy) tests you've had in life so far.

### Ideas
The way to get a startup idea is not to try think of startup ideas. The best startup ideas are the ones you wont even realise they're potential startup ideas to begin with.

Learn a lot about things that matter, work on problems that interest you and with people you like and respect. This is also how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea. If you get yourself to the forefront of some technology, you will live in the future. Ideas that others think are prescient will be obvious to you because you know what ought to exist.
