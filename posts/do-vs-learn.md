A question that I struggled with for the longest time is trying to decide between when one is ready to start doing. I spoke with a friend and colleague of mine (Junhao) and he told me that like with many aspects in life, a decision like this is never just black and white nor is it irreversible. Quite obvious in hindsight but I guess it helps to write it out. Regardless of Whether you are learning or doing, you are also reinforcing the other activity.

The goal is not to let anything block you from progressing so if for example, something blocks you from progressing further in your work, you go back to learning to understand how to unblock it. This is a balance that one needs to be able to strike. Similar to Schr√∂dinger's cat, you are both ready enough and never ready enough so you might as well just start today.
