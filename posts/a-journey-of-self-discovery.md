This is a live document that I created to help me with the process of discovering and understanding myself. As a reminder to myself (and anyone who plans to do this), it is imperative not to deny youself simply because society deems some of these traits at negative. Everyone is flawed, you need to first come to terms with who you are otherwise you will never truly accept who you are.

# Priorities (sorted)

- Freedom (choice)
- Family (relationships)
- Fitness (health)
- Everything else

# Tenets I try to live by

- Time - Time is your most important asset so choose wisely what you spend your time on.
- Patience - Patience is a virtue. Good things will come to those who wait.
- Fear of rejection & failure - It is okay to be afraid but you need to find the courage to keep pressing forward.
- Honesty - Honesty triumphs everything. Life is hard enough, don't give others a reason to doubt your intentions.
- Risk - The biggest risk is not taking enough risks (calculated or not). Sometimes all you need to do is take that first step.
- Risk management - When taking risks, you need to manage your exposure. There are surprisingly a lot of things you can control so stop making excuses.
- Life - Life is not a zero sum game. You can do well by doing good.
- Luck and privilege - There are a lot of things you cannot control in life, luck and privilege are two of them. Don't fret over things you have no control.
- Death - Death is always at your doorstep. Remember the past, live in the present and plan for the future.
- Regret - The only regret you can have is not making that decision for yourself. Regardless of your choice, there will be things you like and dislike. There is no reason to cry over spilled milk because you can't change the past.

# Little things I enjoy in life

- Minimalism
- Simplicity
- Rain
- A nice cup of coffee
- Driving on an empty road
- Spending time with my family and friends
- Silence

# Note to self

- Take many small achievable steps instead of trying to do a few large risky steps. The former depends on you, the latter on luck.
- If you're not excited about what you're doing, why are you doing it?
- Avoid comparing yourself to others. As long as you keep moving forward, you are golden.
- Be useful, kind and generous to others.
