This is a live document I've created to help me with the process of discovering and understanding one's true self. As a reminder to myself (and anyone who plans to do this), it is imperative not to deny oneself simply because society deems some of these traits at negative. Everyone is flawed, you need to first come to terms with who you are otherwise you will never truly be in sync with yourself.

# Priorities (sorted)
- Family (relationships)
- Fitness (health)
- Freedom (choice)
- Everything else

# Tenets I try to live by
- Time is your most important asset. Choose wisely what you spend your time on.
- It is okay to be afraid of failure and rejection. You need to find the courage within to keep pressing forward.
- Regret means there was a correct choice and you made the wrong one. Make that decision for yourself.
- Honesty triumphs everything. Don't let others doubt your true intentions.
- The biggest risk is not taking enough risks. Sometimes all you need to do is to take that first step.
- Life is not a zero sum game. Do well by doing good.
- Luck and privilege exists. Don't fret over things you have no control over.
- Death is always at your doorstep. Remember the past, live in the present, plan for the future.
