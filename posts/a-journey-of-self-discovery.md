This is a live document that I created to help me with the process of discovering and understanding myself. As a reminder to myself (and anyone who plans to do this), it is imperative not to deny youself simply because society deems some of these traits at negative. Everyone is flawed, you need to first come to terms with who you are otherwise you will never truly accept who you are.
# Priorities (sorted)
- Freedom (choice)
- Family (relationships)
- Fitness (health)
- Everything else

# Tenets I try to live by
- Time is your most important asset. Choose wisely what you spend your time on. Patience is a virtue.
- It is okay to be afraid of failure and rejection. You need to find the courage within to keep pressing forward.
- The only regret that you can have is not making that decision for yourself. Regardless of what you choose, there'll be things you like and dislike. 
- Honesty triumphs everything. Don't let others doubt your true intentions.
- The biggest risk is not taking enough risks. Sometimes all you need to do is to take that first step.
- Life is not a zero sum game. Do well by doing good.
- Risk management is extremely important. Don't leave things to luck.
- Luck and privilege exists. Don't fret over things you have no control over.
- Death is always at your doorstep. Remember the past, live in the present, plan for the future.
